        <p>
            I have a long history in the academic technology space. Along the way, I've done an insane amount of content generation , and delivered a metric ton of multimedia. I designed &amp; built whole learning systems that married that content to an LMS (like Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard).
        </p>
        <p> 
            That gives me experience,  but what I learned a long time ago is <em>you have to stay current</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following projects are me trying to do just that.

            <p>
                When I joined the Center for eLearning team, one of my first duties was the design and production of <a href="http://cel.fscj.edu/protozoa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a web based learning object template</a> used to deliver FSCJ course content in an adaptive, open, and accessible manner.&ensp;We called it Protozoa. It's an open source, purpose built, single celled organism for <em>educational content</em> that I designed and evolved over time to fit the needs of the content it was built for. It is currently powering over 2000 reusable learning obects shared over hundreds of live courses (and counting). Protozoa allows us to serve our content comfortably from our web server, or embedded in an LMS.
