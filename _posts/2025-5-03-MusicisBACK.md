# Music is BACK!

My music Collection has been restored. All 376 Gigs of music I have collected and curated throughout the years in high-quality digital. 


It has been almost 4 years since I last had this collection online and accessible. Due to the collection size, I have struggled to keep it on a machine through the years. But now, with this new huge SSD, it isn't an issue. I had the collection on a local network shared server and used Plex for a long time, but that soon got unwieldy on my network connection. 


So I just turned it off. Life went on, and here we are.



I have recently switched to using a PC more, which has opened up many possibilities for listening to music. 
I don't want a tool that chews up the precious metadata on my collection. I have been fastidious in keeping up with the proper song and album names, and the original album art in a decent resolution looks good but doesn't weigh down the files themselves. 

So now that I am on Windows, VLC player is giving me all that I need. Even fun visualizations. 

Good Times.
