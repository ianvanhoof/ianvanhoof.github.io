    I remember pretty far back. I am kind of surprised how far really. Have you ever tried to remember far far back. If you think hard, in a quiet room you may be able to go farther back than you realize. I was born in 1970, and so it has been a while for me. I tried this morning and had a memory of myself in diapers playing in the back yard with my brother and sister riding this red plastic push motorcycle.

    The memory itself is just a flash of a picture in my mind, but if I put my mind to it I can remember that it was a sunny day with a blue sky. What became our back patio was just a slab, and of all things, I remember the feeling of running around in nothing but a diaper. These days I can just imagine the freedom of a small child. Free to play, run, and shit anywhere they want. It sounds glorious. Anyway. That's my earliest memory, but not my only from those years.
