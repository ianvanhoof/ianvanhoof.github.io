<h2>
    The Muse I've Been Seeking.  
</h2>
<p>
    I have been doing a good amount of challenging work lately, and it has been taking up an inordinate amount of my time. As much as I love taking on these challenges&mdash;it has my life and mind jumbled with overly analytic thoughts. I <em>try</em> to keep these things in balance with my creative side because I feel both are important. So with all this planning...programming, explaining, learning, and producing&mdash;I have a need to do something creative&hellip;Something artistic. 
</p>
<p>
    I've been in this state for a couple of months now. Just looking for something new & creative. Something out of my usual scope, yet still falling into the drawing realm. Why drawing? Well, I still suck at drawing, and would like to further my hand. This was my state of mind when life threw a muse in my path. Melissa, and I were out for dinner. We were in a good mood, and taking our time. Talking and slow walking towards the restaurant as we do. That's when we happened across this stunning white 1971 Nissan Skyline GTR. If you don't know, this is a car that is rare enough that I never thought I would ever see it outside a museum. Here it was...sitting so low I never saw it between the cars until we walked right up on it, gleaming tucked deep & sitting super low compared to the other normal EDVs surrounding it. I am in love with the lines of this car. I was gob smacked when I happened across it in that parking lot.

    Regardless of all that I already felt rushed because we had reservations with two other couples. Melissa recognized my adulation, and urged me to stop and take a picture. She knows how much I love cars, and with this one it was obvious by the look on my face. It didn't take long&mdash;I know my angles. I took one low from the front, and another from the rear. It's all I need really.

That car is emblazoned in my mind. I don't know who owns it, but I am truly grateful to have come across it. Eventually I'll update this post with the pics I took that day, but for now I am using them as the basis of my next drawing.</p>
