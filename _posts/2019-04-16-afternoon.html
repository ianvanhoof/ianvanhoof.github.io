    I Remember...
</h2>

<p>
    I remember being a bare foot kid growing up in the wilds of Ormond Beach FL walking out my front door to bust out for the day, and walking straight across the gravel driveway. No problem for my young feet at the time. Make a left down the hill, walk a block, make a left on McIntosh, one more block then a right on Hernandez, two blocks on your left was the Magic Market. Where all kinds of sundry could be obtained.

    My regular list usually contained a huge pack of super pink cubes of Bubblious bubble gum, and a bottle of grape Nehi soda. Before walking back, loiter in the shade to drink the Nehi before turning it in for the nickel deposit. Once paid...two blocks down North Young back to a right on Kenilworth then up to McIntosh again to swing by and see if my best buddy was home.

    Savoring this memory today to savor that feeling of freedom if only for a moment.
