        My latest project is repurposing my website ianvanhoof.com from a Jekyll-based semi-blogging platform into a one-page, blazing-fast HTML/CSS hand-coded speed demon that shows off my front-end skills.
To challenge myself, I want to see how far I can go using only my open source project <a href="https://github.com/fscjCEL/protozoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Protozoa</a> for layout and no JS whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
            We built <a href="https://github.com/fscjCEL/protozoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Protozoa</a> to exist in any web environment you throw it at, so I will use that to lay out the page. For simplicity's sake, I will start with a straight semantic HTML structure and build from there.

            <a href="https://github.com/fscjCEL/protozoa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Protozoa</a> is a CSS framework that allows you to lay out your content in a magazine-style layout without compromising the semantic structure. It needs an update to Grid and Flex-Box, but we tested it so well, and the web is inherently backwards compatible, that all of our heavily tested code is still working in any app I use it in. I have used Protozoa while working at both VMware and Carbon Black to help lay out content in the most archaic content management systems you can imagine. It just works.

            I am getting ahead of myself, though. My first step is always to develop the content. I plan to use my website as a living resume, a place to display my front-end code work, and brag about myself. I currently use JEKYLL because I like to blog occasionally. Still, I no longer want those posts on the front page. I want to play around a bit, and a one-page website is the way. I will do any blogging on the Medium platform. Not that I do all that much blogging in the first place, but I enjoy writing my thoughts down every once in a while.
