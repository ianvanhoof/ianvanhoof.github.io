# I have been changing a lot of code in the background

This website is my playground after all, and I wanted to integrate my Protozoa CSS more into the every day running of this website. That means a switch back to HTML posts instead of Markdown, which I think will speed up my workflow. It's nice being back in the front end web code again.
