# Sitting in This Feeling

I am uncomfortable. I can't seem to fully relax. I know this feeling is caused by the fact that I got laid off from my job, and in these times of economic uncertainty, this is not the best timing. 


In my mind, I know that events such as these can cause irrational anxiety and fear around all the things that I have no control over. Knowing all this doesn't stop it from happening, nor does it improve my feelings regarding the fact that I no longer have a paycheck.


I am not a fan of totally positive thinking. Thinking positively has its place, but it can mask certain emotional energies that one can and should take advantage of. I am harnessing this uncomfortable energy to land a new job.
