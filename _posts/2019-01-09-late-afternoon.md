While waiting for a client to get back to me&mdash;I started working on this website again, not the posts, but the design. I like the tightess, and grayness if you squint your eyes, of the in-line paragraphs on the front page. 

I am not sure if I will continue that style on the article page itself, but we will see about that when I'm actually working on the home page. I do know that on the article page I currently have two styles of paragraph distinction clashing. I am both indenting the first line, and puttin a space between paragraphs. I chose the in-line front page style because I wanted the space, and visual tone of in-line paragraphs. 

On the article page I think I will switch it to spaces between each paragraph. I have the room, so I might as well use it. That is for another day though. I am in Canvasville today. Not working on this website. Regardless, before I go live I would like to get the content from my current homepage integrated into this new cms. Maybe a couple buttons up there in the top left.
