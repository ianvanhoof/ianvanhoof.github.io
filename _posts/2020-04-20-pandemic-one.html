    There are so many negative things that you can focus on these days. I will not outline them all here because it would bring me down. In these days of social isolation–those of us who can–are inside the house living with each other. These aren’t normal circumstances, far from it. Usually, my family is away at work, while I am alone here at the house. We don't usually spend very much time together, and conversations are bound to turn negative. That is why, this morning, I’m taking stock of  some of the positive things that have occurred over the past year and how, oddly, it all seems to work for us.

    One year ago I was trying to improve my drawing skills, I worked at FSCJ as a multimedia engineer, and I drove to work five out of seven days. 
</p>

    Some things don't change that much. I’m still trying to become a better illustrator. I have recently been going through an Andrew Loomis book and wanted to start adapting more of his techniques in my style. If you can call it that. The largest issue I am having to moving forward is if I draw too long it starts to hurt. I can now tell you that pain is not a positive motivator when trying to be creative and draw. To remedy that–, I am drawing with more frequency and with shorter sessions.  I cannot draw for 4 hours straight on a Sunday morning any longer.  So I draw in little spurts now. It’s FINE.

    Another huge positive thing that happened was I left FSCJ. The last position I held there was E-learning Multimedia Engineer. I was on a small team of very specialized people who managed and produced everything  that lay between an instructional design team, and an IT controlled LMS. We took content and made it web friendly at a feverish pace. We managed a web server. We took an academic role on the LMS. Then around June of last year I made the jump out. 
</p>
<p>
    I moved into a remote position at Carbon Black as an LMS Specialist doing much of the same work I did at FSCJ just at a different level and using different tools. It was fast paced which was exactly what I was looking for. When the admin duties had become too routine, CB was kind enough to throw me towards content development. They changed my role to an instructional designer, and I got to work on the huge amount of existing instruction. That is when everything changed again. In October, Carbon Black was purchased by VMware.  So I became and remained, an instructional designer for VMware.

    I am having a great time these days creating all kinds of stuff. If you can think of media I am producing it–graphics, animations, videos, as well as web and interactive pieces. I regularly use every corner of the Adobe Suite, even the lesser known tools, to get things done on time. I still get to have fun in the web design space as an LMS Admin.  My CSS styles are now all over our course front ends in Moodle and Litmos, but I digress. 
</p>
<p>
Those of you who have worked with me know that this is my happy place.  Being remote, and producing multimedia at a feverish pace is a really good place for me. I realize that.

    I am a remote worker in a pandemic so not much has changed in my professional life. My family cannot say the same. My wife Melissa is an early learning teacher. Her school follows the Duval county school calendar. Duval county just announced that they will be virtual until 2021. We do not know how long she will have a job. My daughter Ava, and son Rowan are both college students who work at Starbucks. Starbucks is closed, and school hasn’t started for them. We are all in the house together. 
</p>
<p>
    That is my biggest change. During my workday, I now have my whole family to contend with.  This is week five of social distancing, and my fingers are still crossed, but so far it seems to be working.
