## Two Things

### <em>Firstly</em>:&ensp;Typography

I sometimes get excited and just do things. I haven't been really able to use [Hoefler & Co. typography](https://www.typography.com) since I was doing print. The jobs/projects/shops I worked on always used Adobe, and so did I. Especially when Adobe announced the new changes to Adobe web fonts. 

Much to my surprise this morning I read about [Hoefler & Co. elevating their web font platform](https://www.typography.com/webfonts/). They expanded to offer every single font in their collection via their cloud service. I am excited to use "new to me" typefaces on the web. I just had to grab that one year subscription to see how the service stacks up to Adobe's. We will see. 


### <em>Secondly</em>:&ensp;Interesting Challenges Using Git with Dropbox

I have recently been exploring using Dropbox as our main hub for local git repositories instead of a service such as Github or BitBucket. The Dropbox sync service across my teams machines has been an interesting management project. I am taking lots of notes, and will get here with them.
