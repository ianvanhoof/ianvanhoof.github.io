## Two Things

### <em>Firstly</em>:&ensp;Typography

I sometimes get excited and just do things. I haven't been able to use [Hoefler & Co. typography](https://www.typography.com) for many years. Since I did print. The jobs/projects/shops I worked on always used Adobe, and so did I. Especially when Adobe announced the new changes to Adobe Typekit web fonts. 

Much to my surprise&mdash;this morning I read about [Hoefler & Co. elevating their web font platform](https://www.typography.com/webfonts/). They started by exposing their entire font library to the cloud service. I am SO EXCITED to use "<em>new to me</em>" typefaces on the web. I just had to grab that one year subscription to see how the service stacks up to Adobe's. We will see. 


### <em>Secondly</em>:&ensp;Interesting Challenges Using Git with Dropbox

I have recently been exploring using Dropbox as our main hub for local git repositories instead of a service such as Github or BitBucket. The Dropbox sync service across my teams machines has been an interesting management project. I am taking lots of notes, and will get here with them.
