<h2>
    There is a Point We All Reach&hellip;
</h2>
<p>
    When I'm working on a project, and it's steaming along, and I feel great about how things look, and feel, and act, but then I reach this point where I start hating on, then deleting, large chunks of what now looks like crap to my eyes. All crap. I feel that somewhere along the line things slowly creep away from the path that you set yourself in the beginning, and it then gets out of hand, and sometimes you are forced to step back and just start hacking off large parts of cancerous growths that have somehow crept their way into your project.
</p>
<p>
    <em>I am going through that process now. Currently hating everything, and hacking.</em>
</p>

    I like the design, not the content structure. Not the content. I need to focus what I want to DO.
