# A Comforting Routine

The most challenging part of not having a job is the loss of routine. Getting up and doing the same things each day is more comforting than you think. 

Those feelings stack up nicely with the ones about looming financial instability. I told myself when this started that my job now is to get another job. It helps that I get up each morning and do my best to get another job, but honestly, I can only keep that up for about 4 hours before getting overwhelmed. My first step to returning that routine comfort is to post to this website daily, maybe redesign it as I go. It's not an eight-hour shift, but I stop when I have no more applications to fill out and then mess around with the website a bit. 

I also have hobbies that keep me busy, such as rebuilding my studio, building Gundam models, and playing video games. Still, I can't completely relax while doing those things with all these unanswered questions in my head. 

However, I must be doing something right because, according to my ring, I have never slept better than I am right now.
