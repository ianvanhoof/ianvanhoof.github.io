# Back to Life, Back to Reality


I have a lot more time on my hands these days so I thought it is about time for me to go through a transformation. For the past five years or so, I have been almost exclusively on a Mac computer. I have an iMac for my personal life to do bills and mess around with my hobbies, and each one of the jobs i've had gives me a Mac laptop to work on. It has been a long time since I was on top of all the latest hardware and so I did the what any smart father would do and asked my son to help me. 

He is so much more versed in today's hardware than I am, and I wanted to get up and running quickly not get bogged down in a PC parts research rabbit hole. He told me what to order and I ordered all the stuff. It was a couple of months ago that we started ordering parts, but finally they all came in and one night, we took over the dinner table and built it into a new Lian Li case.

These Lian Li cases really are lux, and kinda crazy. I have never mounted the video card that way, and everything is so shiny and lit up. Anyway, the fun part was unboxing all that stuff, and putting it together with my family. Then came the Windows 11 install. 

I did not realize how much it would take to get used to Windows 11. There seems to be two start menus now, which is odd. And I keep getting a .dll error that I can't seem to shake, and that's ok for now. I also forgot how annoying it is to have Norton AntiVirus install utility, sneaking in with the motherboard utility that is a must to have.   

Now, I need to get my design tools up and running. I will likely have to make some concessions because they don't have a PC version of xScope.
