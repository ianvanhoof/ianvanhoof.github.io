# Today Feels Normal to Me


Today feels like a normal day. I woke up thinking about how to fix this stupid mistake on my PC, not the fact that I just got laid off. It was a great idea to switch around my office so it didn't feel like the same place I spent the last three years working in. The PC is working its magic as well. It feels so new, like a new haircut. 

Now, if only I could figure out which piece of bloatware installed the .dll that keeps giving me the error every time I start my machine. I have never had an issue like this on the Mac side, but I am at a point where I appreciate having to troubleshoot this issue. It's like the difference between a driving stick and an automatic. You feel more connected to the computer after spending some time troubleshooting a persistent Windows error.
