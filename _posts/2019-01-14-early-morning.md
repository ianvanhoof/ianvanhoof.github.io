## Carburettors aren't the only problem.

This weekend, I spent hours in my garage working on my motorcycle. I did not achieve my final goal of hearing the engine turn over and roar, but I do feel that the steps I took have at least put that within my grasp. My bike has been sitting for about 4 years in one spot. The old carburettors were trashed, and I was done. I made the decision to get a new set of racing carburettors. This would give me the ease & satisfaction of installing a bolt on part, and also offer a nice bit of functional upgrade. I was thinking&mdash;Sure it's not the only fix this bike needs, but this should get the motor running quickly. This weekend I planned to rip out the old carburettors so I could then install the new one. Sounds simple enough...right?

I started by reading every inch of the 3" by 5" instruction booklet that came with the racing carbs. It had things like super small exploded diagrams, those tiny tables that help you tweak the needle settings, and a short history of the company. It does not have any indication of where to hook up your one incoming fuel line, nor does it explain what to do with the electrics that were hooked up to the stock carbs.

I knew I would need some sort of replacement for the accelerator cables previously installed. They were a set I had bought for aesthetics, but which had not withstood the test of time. So I ordered a "new" set of accelerator cables at the same time as the carbs. What I did not know before starting was that the cables that they sent had nothing to do with my bike. They were totally the wrong cables. 

Ripped off the old cables, then discovered they were the wrong ones, so I had to take the time to find an acceptable solution. Which happened to be the old, stock, accelerator cables. Thank goodness I had saved those. One quick cable lube job later, and they work fine. 

With the correct cables installed I could now hook them up to the carburettor. Get the fuel line hooked up, to the correct intake, and installed the carburettor itself. Then the pod filter onto the carb. Capped off all the hanging electrical. Once I had wiped everything off, and installed the battery I was ready to turn it over for the first time. 

Hopped on, made sure it was in neutral, then hit the starter. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. It would not even turn over once, and I was hearing the solenoid clicking because it didn't have enough power to maintain the connection. Bad news. It would not start because my battery is shot. NICE!

Here I was at 9pm on a Sunday night, To attempt a kick start I would have to move a car, and move half the garage. No way. So I hooked up my trusty battery tender, and called it a night. 

I will return...
