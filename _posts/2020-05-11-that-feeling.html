<h3>
    That Feeling You Get While Waiting for a New Lego Set to Show Up. 
</h3>
<p>
    I am on the finishing stages of the James Bond DB5 kit which is one of two I ordered for my birthday.

    The other has taken a really long time to find, then get to my house. I know it's kind of hokey, but I ordered the set of three birds kit, and am really excited that I actually found one online. It being a discontinued kit, I was surprised I finally found it, and got to order it. So many times it would find a listing only to find the product sold out. Patience worked though, and I am hoping to recieve it today.
