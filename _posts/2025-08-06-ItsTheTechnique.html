    When a Door Closes, Look Towards the Window

    <p>I am still working on the Discontinuity Studios website. I came across an interesting problem I worked around and would like to share. </p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>I want the background graphic behind everything to change each time the page loads and fade in smoothly.</p>

<h2>The First Solution</h2>
<p>The first solution I came up with involved setting the body element up with a background</p>

<p>I tend to solve problems by breaking them up into little steps so I built the step that forces a random graphic change each time the page loads first. I set it up beforehand with some indexed graphics in a folder, and I want the JS to load a random background graphic from that folder each time. </p>
<pre><code>body {
background-image: url('/img/backgrounds/1.png');
}</code></pre>

<p>My JS chooses a random number and then uses that to build the body's src attribute.</p>
<pre><code>
const totalImages = 10;
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * totalImages) + 1;
const imagePath = `../img/backgrounds/${randomNumber}.png`;
        const imgElement = body.style.backgroundImage = `url('${imagePath}')`;
</code></pre>
<p>That worked just fine. It blinks in a new image each time the page is loaded. Great.</p>

<p>Now, to move on to build the fade-in. My thought was that using CSS transitions should be easy. I needed to set the transition on the body element's background image.
Simple right.</p>
<pre><code>
body{transition: background-image 3s ease-in;}
</code></pre>
<p>I'll save you the webkit annotation.</p>
<p>That did not work.</p>
<p>I tried giving it a background-image initial setting, so the JS would override the background image using the local attribute.</p>
<p>Nope, no fade in.</p>
<p>The timing of loading the graphic and then animating that graphic using CSS transitions timing is funny. Hmm, an interesting problem to solve, but I don't have time for this.
I needed a different solution, but didn't want to throw away all that JS.</p>

<h2> The Final Solution</h2>

<p>The solution that worked. Instead of messing with the body, I chose to insert a DIV stretched across the entire viewport in the background of everything.</p>
<h3>The HTML</h3>
<pre><code>
<div id="background-image"></div>
</code></pre>
<h3>The CSS</h3>
<pre><code>
#background-image {

    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    position: fixed; /* Or absolute, to stay in the background */
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    z-index: -1; /* Place it behind all other content */
}</code></pre>
<h3>The JS</h3>
<p>My JavaScript now looks like this.</p>
<pre><code>
const totalImages = 10;
        const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * totalImages) + 1;
        const imagePath = `../img/backgrounds/${randomNumber}.png`;
        const imgElement = document.getElementById("background-image");
        imgElement.style.backgroundImage = `url('${imagePath}')`;
        gsap.from("#background-image", { opacity: 0, duration: 7 });
</code></pre>

<p>It chooses a random number, like before. Still, now it inserts that random number into the src attribute of our div element.</p>
<pre><code>
imgElement.style.backgroundImage = `url('${imagePath}')`;
</code></pre>

<p>I then use GreenSock JS to animate the fade-in on that same element.</p>
<pre><code>
gsap.from("#background-image", { opacity: 0, duration: 7 });
</code></pre>

<p>It works so well each time that I will add it to my snippet library.</p>
