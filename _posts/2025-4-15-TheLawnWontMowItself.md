# The Lawn Won't Mow Itself, but Taxes Take Priority

Unfortunately, I had to pay my taxes yesterday. Great News, I got a refund this year, and it didn't even take me that long. Anyway, I planned to mow my lawn yesterday until I remembered what day it was. So, I deferred that task until today. Hopefully, this weather holds. 

I also want to get my music back online; my whole synth setup has been offline since I reconfigured my office. That conversation brings up a whole new subject. It's time for my website, this website, to transform its design. I will start with the type design first. Then, change the vertical spacing and move on to integrating graphics. We will see what pops out on the other end. Time to go look for some type combination inspiration.  

Wow, I just discovered that my Documents folder defaults to the One Drive version instead of my local drive. 
I am going to have to fix that soon. What a pain.
