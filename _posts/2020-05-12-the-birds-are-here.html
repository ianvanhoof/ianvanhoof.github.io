<h2>
    An Unexpected Delivery for my Birthday.
</h2>

<p>Full Disclosure. Ever since I was a little boy, I have enjoyed building lego. I wanted to experience that feeling again as a present to myself for my 50th birthday.</p> 
<p>
I have had my eye on a couple of kits for many years. I know what you are thinking. He must want a Star Wars kit. Who doesn't want an Imperial Star Destroyer or the Millenium Falcon? I do, and maybe someday I will get those, but US $700 no. 
I have always had my eye on the James Bond DB5 and the Birds kit. I was surprised to find that they are on the endagered kit list. 
</p>
<p>
I went straight to Lego to get the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/james-bond-aston-martin-db5-10262">James Bond DB5 Kit</a>. I wish you luck trying to find one now, but I got one and could not wait to start it, so I did. Welcome to the pandemic.
</p>
<h2>
The Bird Kit was another story.  
</h2>
<p>
Lego retired the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/birds-21301">Birds kit</a>. That made it extremely hard to find. It is one thing when they are just out of stock, they always come back, but once a kit is retired, that's it. They become hard to find, or worse, extremely expensive. 
I finally found it on an online toy store for the original price, but even that became a rollercoaster of emotion. The website showed three available. I went all the way through the process of purchasing it, and then I noticed they took my money out of my account. That is always a good sign. It usually means the shipping notice is soon to follow.
</p>
<p>
That is not what happened. What happened was five days later, I see the money refunded into my account. No update email; they just gave me my money back. Sucks, but I waited patiently for the update email telling me I had lost the item. 
It was two days after the refund that the company once again took out the money from my account. Then a shipping email came. 
After two more weird shipping delays, I was having doubts about whether I would ever get the damn thing. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, as I was finishing up the James Bond DB5 kit, I heard the ring at the front door. It was the birds kit. A little worse for wear on the outside, but still intact with lego stickers holding everything tightly closed. 
I am a little melancholy that this delivery will be the last of my pandemic 50th birthday presents. Now all I have left to do is have a party. jk! :-)
