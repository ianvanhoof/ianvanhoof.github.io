# Back to Work Today


Back to work at Armis today and mainly getting my new machine setup. This M1 Mac is currently flying, but I still have to set up Adobe; we will see how that goes. For now, I am having a great time setting all this up. 

I think it is time to dig into setting my Loupedeck up again, and that needs some love every time I reset to a new Mac. At least I  don't have to set up each set of app shortcuts themselves because Loupedeck does a great job of that already. At least for the apps that I need the Loupedeck for, like all the Adobe ones.
