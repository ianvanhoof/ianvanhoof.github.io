I am taking a look at this home page wondering if I should have titles at all. Should this be like Twitter? You know, just display the meat of each post. 

I really like how this looks. Maybe if I make the paragraph spacing look all old school. No margins, no padding, just inline with a 2 character indent for each paragraph. I really like how that looks.
