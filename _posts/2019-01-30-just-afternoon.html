    Python &amp; Beautiful Soup Life Knowledge

<p>
    I'll keep this short because those of you who understand what I am saying won't need much more explanation. Those who don't care for an explanation will be happy, because this might "just work."

        When you're trying to access that sweet sweet innerHTML, and .string doesn't work...just try .get_text().
    </em>
