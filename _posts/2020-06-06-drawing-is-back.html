    Trying to Recharge

<p>I grew up brown, living in the south. I've been called every iteration of the N-word that comes to mind. I want to be out protesting with the black lives matter movement.</p>
<p>
 I have a problem, though, with being on the at-risk list for Covid-19. I still don't feel comfortable going to the store, much less being around a crowd of protestors. I'm proud to say that each of my three kids is out there each day. They are representing our family while I stay out of trouble. </p>

 <p>My big contribution was helping my daughters make some signs for when they go. I wish I could do more.</p>
 <p>
Thank you, kids, for doing what I cannot!

I have been getting back into drawing cars again. This time I am working on a Porshe. I will be posting it soon, so be on the lookout.</p>
