## It's a Cold Brew Morning. 
This morning I woke up tired. 

My coldbrew seems to be helping things out nicely. I was lucky enough to get one of those kits from my kids as a gift, and I have been enjoying tinkering with it ever since.

I love cold brew, and when I got the kit I didn't realize all that was involved in the craft. Since getting the kit&mdash;I have found that you can get OK results, assuming you got the grind correct, if you buy an expensive bean. I would rather get extraordinary results from a cheap bag of beans. Through research and experimentation I feel the key to extracting that golden taste from a cheap beans is precision. 

To get to the level of precision I wanted&mdash;I chose to purchase a digital kitchen scale. The scale allows me to put exactly the amount of coffee I need to achieve that golden water to coffee ratio I am looking for. For cold brew that ratio is 1:17. I'm not sure if each kit is different, but to get that ration I need exactly 110g of dry ground coffee in the micro&ndash;filter. I then fill the caraph to the max fill line, and let that sit in the cold for 18-24 hours. 

Now that I have precision control I can play around with the grind size & steep time to get the perfect flavor I am looking for. I have to say though, the thing that seems to have the most impact for me was changing the grind size. Because the filter that comes with the kit is one of those super fine steel mesh type filters, my grind has to be more course, but I have found that if you go a bit less course on the grind you get better flavor extraction from the bean. This will understandably leave more residue in your final product. To get rid of that residue I strain it one last time through my chemex filter. The filter gets rid of all that coffee dust floating around, and stops the coffee from brewing any longer than it should. 

## Oh, You Thought You Were Done. 

Nope. 
The brewing process is only half the story. You now have a pot of coffee concentrate. This can be mixed to create all kinds of drinks, and desserts. My standard is just a 50/50 ration with water and a little sweetener. My wife enjoys decaf cold brew with a bit of milk and sugar. The other night I mixed a nice rum drink using coffee, rum, and whole milk. You didn't even taste the alcohol. It was so nice. 

The point of all this is you can experiment with both sides of the cold brew brewing process to come up with some very different drinks. You can vary the strength of your coffee either in the beginning, or while you are making you final drink. It is entirely up to you to come up with a result that is tasty, and I am having so much fun experimenting that I always have a perpetual pot cold brewing in my fridge.
