# Still Waiting. 


This new year has been challenging to say the least. I can't say that it was all wrong because we all had a great holiday season. Chloe even came all the way over from San Diego to visit. The only thing that got us was Covid. I am vaccinated and boosted, but that, apparently, wasn't enough to not catch it. It ruined all existing plans and has me behind this new year. My lights are still up, my garage is far from clean, my new office didn't get set up completely, and that was just my list. 

The silver lining to all this is we got trapped in the house with two of our kids. More like they were trapped in the house with us. Which is just fine. We don't see our kids enough as it is, and this was an extension of that. Even sick, I love being around my kids. It just feels right.
