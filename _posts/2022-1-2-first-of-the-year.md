# Still Waiting. 


This whole year has been challenging to say the least. So many things have happened. I entered the year working at VMware, and I now work at Armis. I started the year with both of my daughter living in the United States, now only one is, the other in Belgium goign to school. I am so proud of all my kids. I can't say enough about them.
