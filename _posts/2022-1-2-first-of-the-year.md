# Still Waiting. 


This whole year has been challenging to say the least. So many things have happened. I started working at VMware, and I now work at Armis. I started the year with both of my daughters living in the United States, now only one is, the other in Belgium, going to school. My son is also in school while holding down a job as a data scientist. Words cannot convey how proud I am of all my kids. I can't say enough about them. They are all bright, creative, and aware enough to make it through this world. I just miss them dearly.
