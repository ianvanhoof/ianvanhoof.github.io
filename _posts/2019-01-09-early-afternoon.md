## I'm getting tired

Messing with Canvas all day doesn't help. I think that I will move on to pure design. I need to pull away from the code, and mock up a typical Canvas LMS screen.

I will be working on the typography. So maybe I pull some common content patterns from our existing courses, then use that content to mock up the verical spacing. I got all the fonts from Adobe so it should work out OK if I use inDesign.
