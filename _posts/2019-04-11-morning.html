<h2>
    Valid Art

<p>
    A couple of months ago, I was lucky enough to come across THIS <em>1971 Nissan Skyline</em> just hanging out in the parking lot. This is a car I never thought I would see so I figured I should take this picture while I still could. I felt that before I post the drawing (that I am still working on) I better give you an idea of the picture I am working off of.
