# Monday, Monday

## Good Morning
Today I am working hard on redoing my resume. 

Since leaving FSCJ, I haven't paid much attention to it until I needed to change jobs. Most of the positions in my career I have gotten using my contacts or a conversation, and the resume was only a technicality for HR. This one is different. This is the first time I have ever had to find a job while not having one. This is all a new experience for me. 


So, super tweaking my resume to get past all the technology used to organize the piles of applications is a good idea right now. I also appreciate that tweaking my resume is getting my head where it needs to be for the inevitable interview. 


Of course, this is just the morning. I have so many things I have to do to get my life in order today. I have to get my medical insurance squared away, and I am still shopping for that. I should also make sure my prescriptions are filled before the medical insurance transition. The life of a type-1...always trying to track down my next medication. Not to mention the front lawn needs to be mowed for the first time since I put the new sod down. Mondays are always full. .
