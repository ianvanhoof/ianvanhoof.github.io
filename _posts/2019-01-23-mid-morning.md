## This Morning Held a Variety

This morning was so nice. I got to wake up, and just have a nice cup of cold brew before cooking my normal breakfast. I was smart enough to brew a new pitcher of cold brew the day before yesterday. 

I can't bring myself to call it a pot of cold brew. I don't know why. It's a pitcher of cold brew to me. 

Woke me right up for the day. 

When I got to my desk I was more than ready to work on that python problem I was having yesterday. I got that fixed by working in a different directory than my co-workers while git is involved. This left me open to fix the issue my python was having with yet another out lier course we had found&mdash;HUM2211.

For some reason the HTML files weren't rendering in that one course. The issue was a ANSI encoded character in one of the attribute values. One day, soon, I would love to update all this python to 3+ instead of 2.7. It shouldn't too hard, but it will take time to test everything. From what I have read that would alleviate many of the problems I am having with encoding/decoding. We will see.
