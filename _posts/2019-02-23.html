<h2>
    The Muse I've Been Seeking.  
</h2>
<p>
    I have been doing a good amount of challenging work lately, and it has been taking up an inordinate amount of my time. As much as I love taking on these challenges it has my mind filled with analytic thoughts. I try to keep these things in balance with my creative side because I feel both are important in this life. So with all this programing...planning, and charting I have a need to do something creative. Something artistic. 
</p>

    I have been in this state for a couple of months now, just looking for something new & creative. Something out of my usual scope, yet still falling into the drawing realm. Why drawing? It's one of those life skills that I always work toward. I still suck at drawing, and would like to further my hand. That's when life threw me a muse. My wife, and I were out for dinner. We were in a good mood, taking our time. Talking and slow walking towards the restaurant as we do. That's when I we happened across the white 1971 Nissan Skyline GTR. If you don't know, this is a car that is rare enough that I never thought I would ever see it outside a museum. Here it was...sitting so low I never saw it between the cars until I walked right up on it. Gleaming tucked deep & low between the other normal EDVs surrounding it. I love the lines of this car. I was gob smacked when I happened across it in that parking lot.

    We also had reservations, and plans to meet two other couples so I didn't have much <em>time</em>. But Melissa recognized my adulation, and urged me to stop and take a picture. It didn't take long&mdash;I know the angles. I took one low from the front, and another from the rear. It's all I need really.

        That car is emblazoned in my mind. I don't know who owns it, but I am grateful to have come across it. Eventually I will update this post with the pics I took that day, but for now I am using them as the basis of my next drawing. I wanted to try out the iPad version of Affinity Designer.
