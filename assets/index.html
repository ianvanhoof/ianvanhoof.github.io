                <p>
                    I've worked many years in the tech field. Most of them in some sort of online capacity. This has given me a unique perspective on the way things work, and as a result I have taken more of a holistic view of things. I guess that comes from experience. Over the years I worn many different hats, but these days I consider myself more a Designer with a capital D more than anything else.
